# Sandwich Club Project
###### Project of [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd801/syllabus/core-curriculum)

## Project Overview
In this project, i've completed the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What I've learn?
- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
